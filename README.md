## Marin County Draft Lifeform Leaflet Map
This is a simple web map created in leaflet that allows users see the publicly available services without needing GIS software or skills. It uses an Esri plugin for consuming vector tiles. 

The map displays a vector tile service hosted publicly on the Parks Conservancy ArcGIS Online organizational page. 

The tile service is the Marin County lifeform map and is a 22-class land use and land cover map of Marin County, reflecting the state of the landscape in summer, 2018. The lifeform map is a draft data product and will be finalized when the fine scale vegetation map is released in 2021. The lifeform map is a foundational input to the fine scale vegetation map. The fine scale vegetation map will have significantly more floristic detail than the lifeform map; woody vegetation communities in the fine scale map will be mapped to the alliance level of the National Vegetation Classification.
